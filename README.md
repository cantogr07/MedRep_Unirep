### Project for ETH Istanbul Privacy Hackathon 2023
We aimed to create an anonymous, reputation-based news website in which users would be able to decide and vote on the credibility of the contents&news they come across.
We struggled while connecting the back-end to the front-end (via smart contracts) so this repo is incomplete, however we want to continue working on the project after the hackathon as well.
